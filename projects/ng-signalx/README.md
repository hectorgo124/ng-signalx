# ng-signalx

> ⚠️ **Notice:** ng-signalx currently supports **Angular 19**.  
> Support for Angular 20 and later versions will be added in future releases.

**ng-signalx** is a small utility library that extends Angular Signals with additional helpers and patterns that make them easier to use in applications.

The goal of the project is simple:  
**provide small, practical extensions on top of the existing Angular Signals API** without trying to replace or reinvent it.

## Features (current / planned)

- `signalxResource` — extends current Angular resource() with `filter` option
- More small utilities coming soon

## Installation

```bash
npm install ng-signalx
```
